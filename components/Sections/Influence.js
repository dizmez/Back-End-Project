          Avatar is notable for borrowing extensively from Asian art and
          mythology to create its fictional universe. Explicitly stated
          influences include Chinese art and history, Korean clothing and folk
          tales, Japanese anime, Hinduism, Taoism, Buddhism, and yoga. The art
          style of the fictitious locations used in the series are based on real
          locations in Asia. Sites such as the Forbidden City and the Great Wall
          of China in Beijing were inspirations for the Earth Kingdom city of Ba
          Sing Se,and Water Tribe locations were based on Inuit and Sireniki
          cultures.

          The fighting styles employed by the show's characters are derived from
          Chinese martial arts. Each fighting style is unique to the "benders"
          who use them or characters who are aligned to a certain element. For
          example, practitioners of "waterbending" use movements influenced by
          T'ai chi and focused on alignment, body structure, breath, and
          visualization. Hung Gar was the inspiration for practitioners of
          "earthbending", and was chosen for its firmly rooted stances and
          powerful strikes as a representation of the solidity of earth.
          Northern Shaolin, which uses strong arm and leg movements, was chosen
          to represent "firebending". Ba Gua, which uses dynamic circular
          movements and quick directional changes, was used for "airbending".
          The Chu Gar Southern Praying Mantis style can be seen practiced by the
          earthbender Toph, who develops a unique fighting style as a result of
          her blindness. Asian cinema influenced the presentation of these
          martial-art bending moves.
