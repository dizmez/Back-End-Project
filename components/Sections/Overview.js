        Avatar: The Last Airbender (Avatar: The Legend of Aang in some regions)
        is an American animated television series created by Bryan Konietzko and
        Michael Dante DiMartino. Avatar is set in an Asiatic-like world in which
        some people can manipulate the classical elements with psychokinetic
        variants of the Chinese martial arts known as "bending". The series is
        presented in a style that combines anime with American cartoons and
        relies on the imagery of East/South Asian, Inuit, and New World
        societies. It primarily follows the protagonists, 12-year-old Aang and
        his friends, who must bring peace and harmony to the world by ending the
        Fire Nation's war with the rest of the Four Nations.
