              Water is the element of change. The moon is the source of power in
              waterbending, and the original waterbenders learned to bend by
              observing how the moon pushed and pulled the tides. The Water
              Tribes are the only people who did not learn bending from an
              animal, though the Moon and Ocean Spirits took the form of koi
              fish in the mortal world near the beginning of the Avatar world.

              The fighting style of waterbending is mostly fluid and graceful,
              acting in concert with the environment. Foggy Swamp style
              waterbending, however, is more rigid and straight. Waterbenders
              deal with the flow of energy; they let their defense become their
              offense, turning their opponents' own forces against them. Even
              when waterbenders do take an attack stance, their moves always
              appear to flow from one to the other.
