          <h1>Aang</h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            Aang was a male Air Nomad born in 12 BG and the Avatar during the
            century-long conflict known as the Hundred Year War. His immediate
            predecessor was Avatar Roku, and his immediate successor is Avatar
            Korra. As the Avatar of his time, he was the only person capable of
            using all four bending arts: airbending, waterbending, earthbending,
            and firebending. He was also one of a select few Avatars, and one of
            the first in many cycles to learn the ancient art of energybending,
            and the first Avatar known to have actively used the technique.

            <br />
            Shortly before the beginning of the Hundred Year War, Aang was
            frozen in an iceberg for a hundred years; he later emerged, still
            biologically twelve years old, into a world engulfed by war. During
            his absence, the Fire Nation had waged war upon the other nations
            and managed to completely wipe out the pacifistic Air Nomads. It
            fell to Aang, the Avatar and the last airbender, to end the War by
            mastering the other three elements and defeating Fire Lord Ozai. He
            remained a kind and goofy kid at heart throughout his year-long
            struggle, despite the overwhelming loss of his people and the heavy
            burdens he was forced to bear. After his victory over the Phoenix
            King, Aang began a romantic relationship with his close friend,
            Katara. The couple eventually married and raised a family of three
            children: Bumi, a nonbender who became an airbender later in life,
            Kya, a waterbender, and the youngest, Tenzin, an airbender.

          <h1>Early Life</h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            Aang was born to two Air Nomads in 12 BG. After selecting the Avatar
            relics from among thousands of toys, thereby inadvertently
            confirming his identity as the Avatar, he was taken away by the
            monks of the Southern Air Temple, who kept his position a secret
            from him. As an Air Nomad, Aang traveled extensively around the
            world. During his childhood, Aang was housed, raised, and educated
            at the Southern Air Temple, under the guardianship of Monk Gyatso,
            who served as his father figure, counselor, and tutor. As a child,
            Aang was a member of the Air Scouts, where he learned essential
            skills such as how to tie reins to a bison's horns with the bison
            horn knot. After some time, he and several other young Air Nomad
            boys were taken to the Eastern Air Temple where they each chose a
            sky bison as their lifelong companion. Aang approached his
            soon-to-be sky bison Appa and offered him an apple, which Appa
            accepted, thus marking the start of their deep and lifelong
            friendship.

          <p>
            Aang was always able to excel at any new bending moves he learned;
            at the age of six, he was a better airbender than children twice his
            age, and by the age of ten, Aang had proven himself to be better
            than his own teachers. He earned airbending tattoos and the status
            of an airbending master by the age of twelve for exhibiting
            prodigious talent with his native element and with his invention of
            the air scooter, making him the youngest airbending master in Air
            Nomad history.Due to the signs of a possible war approaching, Aang
            was told about his status as the Avatar at age twelve, four years
            earlier than the traditional age of sixteen. Aang felt burdened by
            his status as the other children refused to play with him anymore
            and he came to spend more time practicing airbending with the monks.
            Monk Gyatso was the only one who showed understanding of Aang's
            burden, having been good friends with Avatar Roku, Aang's past life,
            and tried to help ease Aang through the transition from childhood to
            adulthood by providing Aang with balance through fun during the
            upheaval in his life.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h1> Personality</h1>
          <p>
            <br />
            Aang was fun-loving, somewhat naive, and adventurous with a sense of
            humor. He possessed a deep respect for life and freedom, refused to
            eat meat and was often reluctant to fight in his younger years.[8]
            He craved the stimulation of new people and places. His frequent
            off-course detours frustrated both allies and pursuers alike. He
            typically wished to forget his duties as the Avatar and would long
            for the normality that others possessed. Yet Aang had always prided
            himself on a complex social network of friends extending over all
            four nations, and war did not stand in his way. In addition, he
            looked forward to playing with all the exotic fauna in each place he
            visited. Whether it was otter penguins, hopping llamas, hog monkeys,
            or giant koi fish, no fit animal Aang saw went un-ridden.
            <br />
            <br />
            Within this carefree exterior, however, Aang hid a great deal of
            guilt and a heavy mental burden in his duties as Avatar. As the
            reluctant hero, he wished he had been there to help his people a
            century earlier. This initially caused him to conceal his true
            identity from friends, and he still had a tendency to slack off in
            his studies of the bending arts, even though he naturally excelled
            at them. He also tended to become distressed when he saw destruction
            caused by the Hundred Year War, believing that as the Avatar, it was
            his job to prevent such events from happening. Eventually, Aang
            decided to stop dwelling on the past; however, on several occasions,
            his desire to end the War caused him to take desperate action such
            as attempting to induce the Avatar State[28] or facing Fire Lord
            Ozai before he had fully mastered the elements.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h1>Ablities</h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            As a reincarnation of the entity known as the Avatar, Aang possessed
            the power to bend all four elements, making him the most powerful
            bender of his time. Though Avatar Roku said mastering the elements
            could take many years, Aang was able to learn all four with
            considerable skill in a year, though technically he did not
            completely master all four as stated by Zuko and Toph.[49] As a
            result of his unconventional training, Aang never demonstrated most
            of the special subsets of the bending arts. However, he did display
            the abilities of lightning redirection and seismic sense, making him
            the first Avatar known to have learned these abilities. Most Avatars
            were not told of their status until they were sixteen years of age,
            but Aang had become a Fully Realized Avatar while he was still only
            biologically twelve years old. Thus, he became the youngest known
            Avatar to do so. As he was chronologically 112 years old, Aang also
            has the distinction of taking the longest to achieve this status.
            <br />
            <br />
            Aang could use his glider staff with great skill as well, using it
            as a method of transport and sometimes for attack, defense, or
            bending.[84]
            <br />
            <br />
            Aside from his combat skills, Aang displayed an impressive degree of
            artistic talent on a few occasions. He was an extremely talented and
            agile dancer, being able to perform somersaults in mid-air among
            other acrobatic feats and coordinate with Katara in a dance. His
            somersaults at that time did not seem to be aided by airbending, as
            he was in a public area surrounded by Fire Nation students and there
            was no sign of any air currents around him. Aang also displayed a
            degree of musical talent, as he was able to play an airbender's
            flute well enough for the Official Avatar Aang Fan Club to revel in
            his performance. He was also able to play the tsungi horn, although
            he was self-admittedly terrible at it.
